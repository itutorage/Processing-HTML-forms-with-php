Tutorial on how to create a simple contact form on your website -for beginners

This is just for beginners who are looking for a simple way to understand how an HTML form can be processed with php. 
It is also an opportunity for them to see how an automatic message can be sent from our website.

*Usage

**index.php
just copy everything from the index.php file to where you want to use the form

**style.css
This file contrains some little css that is in charge of giving a bit beauty to the form. So you can decide to change some stuffs into it.

**style.min.css
This one is not really going to be usefull. 
In case you decide to use the form in production as i made it, then you can upload the style.mini.css instead of the style.css;
because the .mini.css is lighter.

Hope that helps someone.
